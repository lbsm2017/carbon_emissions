# Carbon course project

This **GitHub repo** gathers material for a course on links between emissions, the economy, the financial markets, and the environment.  
The **first session** is a data-driven exploration of the correlation between the notions mentioned above.  
It is centered around this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/shokru/carbon_emissions/blob/main/E4_main.ipynb).   
The **second session** focuses on sustainable investing and the corresponding master notebook is [here](https://github.com/shokru/carbon_emissions/blob/main/carbon_finance_main.ipynb)
