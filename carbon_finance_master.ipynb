        "- Label [**ISR**](https://www.lelabelisr.fr) (investissement socialement responsable): launched in 2016 by the Ministry of the Economy and Finance, but updated regularly (2020 last time). Focused on French funds. Six pillars, with ESG at the center, and evaluation of **impact**.\n",
        "- Label [**GreenFin**](https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/label-greenfin): created in 2015 by Ministry of the Ecological Transition, but certified by third parties such as Novethic, EY France and Afnor. It forbids investment in fossil fuel companies as well as in those producing nuclear energy.\n",
        "- Label [**Finansol**](https://www.finance-fair.org/pourquoi-un-label/): created in 1997 by a non-for-profit association and attributed by a group of independent experts.\n",
        "- Label [**Finance Participative pour une Croissance Verte**](https://financeparticipative.org/label-croissance-verte/): a label dedicated to **crowdfunding**.  The labelling is done by independent platforms. \n",

        "- **green bonds** are bonds issued to finance green projects (e.g., that have social or environmental benefits). Portfolios of such bonds can be packaged in tradeable funds, and many have quote on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CGAFX/).  \n",
        "- **green equity trackers** (Equity Traded Funds): it's impossible for retail investors to invest in many green stocks to obtain sufficient diversification. ETFs are here to help. However, the rules that set the portfolio composition are often opaque. **ESG** comes in many flavours...\n",

        "Many studies have sought to determine if green investments fare better or worse than broad market indices. Results diverge, to say the least (see Chapter 4 in [PISEI](http://www.esgperspectives.com)). Several contributions indicate that the relationship between sustanability and performance is **nonlinear**. For instance, both very brown and very green firms can perform well, while those \"in the middle\" have lower average returns. \n",
